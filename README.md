# Heardle Base

A "glitch.me" heardle clone. Based on the [Mario Heardle](https://ninjigalaxy.github.io/mario-heardle/).

## Why?

The answer is simple, extendability. I wanted to make custom heardle with quality of life features, 
like Mario Heardle's tag feature, but, I didn't wanna deal with the obfuscated compiled source code of the 
recommanded Heardle templates.

The Heardle clone, made in Vue.js is made to have a nice readable source code, to add every feature needed. 
and easy to use to modify simple aspect easily. One feature is using .json file to put informations, like themes, settings and musics.
This allows easier updatability even if you are not a developer.

## Roadmap
- [x] Feature Clone of the Mario Heardle.
- [x] Easily expandable architecture.
- [x] Easy theme manager
- [x] Fix "end of playlist" bug of the original Heardle.
- [ ] Difficulty Settings.
- [ ] Documentation

## Contribution
I am no web developer, so I know some of my code may be bad. If you see any possible fix, or cleanup to my code, 
feel free to make a PR, and explain why you did these changes! For now, there are no code style guideline.

For new feature, though, please open an issue first, and I will personally approve or not. 
Remember this is a base for custom "Heardle" game. 
So if your new feature idea might only be useful to your heardle specifically, 
I might unfortunately refuse to add it to this repository. 
But please, do feel free to share your approach with other people as inspiration,
I would love to see my passion project being tinkered with by other peoples!
